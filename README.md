# Student Intro to Generative AI tools

I am collecting some introductory guides for students to use generative AI tools. These tools are useful for generating text, images, and other media. They can be used for creative projects, but also for research and data analysis. I will continue to add to this repo as I put together more resources. I will also add some of my own notes and thoughts on the tools.
